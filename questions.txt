What is your favorite movie?
This question is incredibly tough for me, as I like to think of myself as a movie buff, but since I have
to choose, I have to go with Interstellar or the Dark Knight. Can't go wrong with Christopher Nolan!

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
I would take a trip to South America. South America is the one of the continents I have yet to truly
explore, and places like the Bolivian salt flats or Patagonia in Chile are on the top of my list
for places to see.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
Super speed, no doubt in my mind. I would have so much time to learn and do things that I love to do.
I could travel and see more of the world than any one person ever has in a lifetime. I would have the
time of an immortal to do whatever I want, but without the pitfall of outliving all your loved ones.
I could read all the books I wanted to, reading more of the great stories and literature that the
best of humankind had to offer, go to every country, learn every song on the guitar and piano, etc.
The possibilites are endless with superspeed.
